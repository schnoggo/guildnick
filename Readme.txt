GuildNick

Description
===========

GuildNick is a World of Warcraft AddOn.

It displays your "main" character name to other members of your guild in chat.
Guild leaders simply need to put your "main" name in the guild note for each character.
This was originally developed for Phoenix Tear on Whisperwind where the notes for alts start with and equal sign and the name of the main toon.
i.e. "=BigTanky"

I will add other formats as requested.

Installation
============

Extract the files into your World of Warcraft Interfaces/AddOns directory.

Configuration
=============
At this time, there is no real configuration. Just have the guild leaders edit the member notes.
